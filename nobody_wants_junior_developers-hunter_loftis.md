lots of opportunity 

no one wants junior engineer

3 techniques to go from junior to senior

1. Specialize in `new` stuff
2. Embrace "good enough"
3. BYOE - Bring your own experience


### 1. Specialize in `new`

"I got the job because nobody else could even use that version of Flash"

### 2. Embrace "good enough"
