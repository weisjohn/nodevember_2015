### keynote - yehuda katz

Ezra Kline - awesome work/team

Steve Jobs - 1995 "take the best and to spread it around to everybody"

Build things that empower people...

Real companies that ship real software use frameworks

Ember - Ghost FE uses Ember, Gelato, intercom.io, heroku dashboard

Does somebody who uses Ember start new companies who also use Ember

(maybe they're too busy starting a company to learn a new framework...?)

today's frameworks have good escape hatches when you need them
